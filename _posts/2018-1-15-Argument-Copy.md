title: Copy by Value or Reference
---

In this article, I will discuss whether Python is copy by value or by
reference. It turns out Python is neither copy by value nor copy by
reference. Python is copy by assignment. When you pass a value to
a function, the function will create a local variable and initialize it with
the value.
